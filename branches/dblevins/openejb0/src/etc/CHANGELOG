- We actually have a deploy tool
- Beans are deployed from their jars
- The ejb-jar.xml is validated using XSD
- The data in an ejb-jar.xml is validated with regular expressions
- New configuration file openejb.conf, similar to the Apache
  httpd.conf style
- Specify a dir where your deployed jars will be loaded, then just
  throw 'em in
- The entire configuration is validated, for example:
        - Duplicate Container IDs            Error
        - Duplicate Bean IDs                 Warning
        - Duplicate Resource IDs             Error
        - Bean not deployable                Warning
        - False codebase for Container Impl  Error
        - False codebase for bean jar        Warning
- OpenEJB services are now packaged in jars and deployed in
  the openejb.conf file.
- There are default openejb.conf and service-jar.xml, etc.
- Scripts for launching deploy tool
- Scripts for launching the OpenEJB/CORBA server
- About 50 new detailed error messages relating to your system
  configuration alone.  You should never get a mysterious stack trace
- New modular build system
- Fixed major bug in IntraVM serialization that severely affected the 
  container-server contract.
- Complete rewrite of Transaction Handling, several bugs fixed
- Rewrite of Exception Handling, now much more spec compliant
- Added logging
