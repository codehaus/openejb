    <section title="Installing the PuTTY program">
      <p>
      PuTTY is a fully featured SSH client for Windows operation systems.
      PuTTY is available from the PuTTY <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">web site</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      Note: You need a couple of binaries, the PuTTY program itself
      is not enough.
      <ul>
        <li>PuTTY.exe - The SSH client</li>
        <li>PSCP.exe - A secure copy program</li>
        <li>PLINK.exe - a command-line interface to the PuTTY back ends</li>
        <li>PAGEANT.exe - an SSH authentication agent for PuTTY, PSCP and Plink</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      
      <section title="Including your PuTTY binaries in your default PATH">
        <p>
        You have to include the PuTTY binaries mentioned above in
        your system's default PATH. To do so add a file like the
        following the your system's PATH environment variable.
        
        <pre><![CDATA[
        set PATH=C:\PROGRAM FILES\PUTTY;%PATH%
        ]]></pre>
        
        Note: This is just an example!
        </p>
        
        <p>
        To test your PuTTY installation, you can try to type the following
        command at the command prompt of a dos box.
        
        <pre><![CDATA[
        plink [developername]@shell.sourceforge.net
        ]]></pre>
        
        Change [developername] to your SF developer name. If the command
        succeeds you should be able to login to the SF system.
        </p>

      <section title="How to generate your public/private RSA key">
        <p>
        SSH works with private/public asymetric key scheme like it does
        PGP or other asymetric krypto systems. This fact requires that
        you generate a public/private key pair to use WinCVS with SSH (PuTTY).
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Generating these keys using the PuTTY key generator (PUTTYGEN.exe) is pretty easy.
        Just press 'generate' and move your mouse over the blank area until the key
        gets generated.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        After the procedure has finished you have to save the private/public key
        pair in a _SECURE_ place on your system by using the 'save public/private'
        buttons.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Usually the private key is named ...
        
        <pre><![CDATA[
        identity
        ]]></pre>
        
        and the public key is named ...
        
        <pre><![CDATA[
        identity.pub
        ]]></pre>
        </p>
        
        <section title="A word from the wise (security note)">
        <p>
        The private key should _NEVER_ leave your system! Keep it as private
        as possible!
