                Getting Started Guide -- Get the source: CVS


Abstract

  Getting involved in any Open Source project requires the source.  This 
  document guides you through the process of getting the OpenEJB 
  project source using the CVS command line client.

1  Introduction
  
  <TO-DO>
  Some text to do a better job introducing this document than the 
  abstract.
  </TO-DO>

2  Get CVS
  
  Before we go into getting the source, let's take a second to answer the 
  question, "What is CVS?".
  
2.1  What is CVS?

  The Concurrent Versions System (CVS) provides network-transparent source
  control for groups of developers.  CVS has four basic functions: 
  
    - Maintains a history of all changes made to each directory tree it 
      manages
    
    - Provides hooks to support process control and change control 
    
    - Provides reliable access to its directory trees from remote hosts 
      using Internet protocols 
      
    - Supports parallel development allowing more than one developer to
      work on the same sources at the same time 

  All the OpenEJB source code, documentation, and other files are in a CVS
  repository an ExoLab server.  To access the repository and download the 
  source code and other files, you need a cvs client.

2.2   Downloading CVS

  The CVS client is available on many operating systems. Choose the CVS 
  client that's right for your OS by following on one of the links below:

    CVS for Windows - ftp://ftp.cvshome.org/pub/cvs-1.10.5/windows/cvs.exe
    CVS for Linux   - ftp://ftp.cvshome.org/pub/cvs-1.10.8/bin/cvs

  <TO-DO>Get a link for the Mac binary and add it above</TO-DO>

  If you don't see your OS listed above, go to the official CVS download  
  page or CVS ftp directory and choose from a complete list of CVS 
  clients. 

  <TO-DO>
  Get a link for the page at cvshome.org where all the OSs are listed.
  </TO-DO>

2.3   Installing CVS

  There is no "Install Shield" for cvs. You just put the cvs executable in
  any directory and then include that directory in your PATH system     
  variable. Then you can execute cvs commands from anywhere in your 
  command shell.

  <TO-DO>Show an example of adding CVS to the PATH variable for Windows 
  Command shell and the Bash shell
  </TO-DO>

  <TO-DO>Come up with a way for people to check to see if they have the  
  CVS binary correctly placed in their PATH.  Something equivalent to
  java -version
  </TO-DO>
  
  <TO-DO>Add some suggestions if the above test doesn't work.</TO-DO>
  
3  Downloading the project source

  In the CVS world, downloading is referred to as checking out. Before you
  can checkout the OpenEJB source from the repository, you need to login.

3.1  Logging into the ExoLab CVS server

  To log into the ExoLab cvs server where the OpenEJB project source
  lives.  Execute the following command in your shell:

  [prompt]$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@openejb.exolab.org:/cvs/openejb login

  When it prompts you for the CVS password, type "anoncvs" without quotes.

  <TO-DO>Add some suggestions if the above command doesn't work.</TO-DO>
  <TO-DO>Give directions for contacting the Administrator admin@exolab.org
  if none of the suggestions work.
  </TO-DO>
  
3.2  Checking out the source

  After you have logged in, you can checkout the source code and execute  
  other CVS commands. To checkout the OpenEJB source, go to the directory 
  where you would like to place the files and execute the following 
  command: 

  [prompt]$ cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@openejb.exolab.org:/cvs/openejb
  checkout openejb 

  NOTE: The text above should be on one line and executed as one command. 

  When you do a checkout, a copy of the newest files in the repository is 
  downloaded to a directory on your local machine. This is called a 
  working copy and is yours to play with, edit, or manage as you see fit. 
  Changes made to your working copy do not become a permanent part of the 
  repository until they are checked in. 

  When files are checked into the repository, they are uploaded from the 
  working copy on your machine to the CVS repository on the ExoLab server.
  The files then become a permanent part of the repository and can be   
  checked out by anyone. 

3.3  Checking in source files (committing)

  Checking in files, known as committing, requires special access which is
  granted on an individual basis. If you would like to contribute changes 
  to files or new files, you can email the files to the openejb-dev 
  mailing list for review.
