        <section title="Monolithic vs. Modular Design" ref-id="modular.design">
        
        <p>OpenEJB represents a
        revolution in application server design, a view that application servers should
        be modular, not monolithic. A modular application server is built from
        subsystems rather than constructed as one huge, tightly coupled platform.
        Modularization of application server software allows vendors to focus on their
        core competencies instead of reinventing every subsystem from scratch to create
        a complete platform. Not only is modularization possible, OpenEJB makes it a
        reality.</p>
        
        <p>OpenEJB is an EJB
        container system - not a monolithic EJB server - that can be plugged into any
        application server to make it a fully compliant EJB server. </p>
        
        <p>The Enterprise JavaBeans
        API itself does not specify a separation of responsibilities among the
        application server, the container, and the primary services (transaction,
        security, and connectors). As a result, EJB vendors must build proprietary
        monolithic application servers to support all the subsystems needed for a
        complete EJB platform.</p>
        
        <p>OpenEJB clearly defines
        the separation of its responsibilities as a container system from those of the
        application server that hosts it, and from the primary services that support
        it. This decoupling enables vendors of application servers, transaction
        managers, and providers of security services and connectors to focus on their
        own specialties, while OpenEJB focuses on delivering a high-speed container
        system that combines the services into a single EJB platform.</p>
        
        <p>This Introduction Section
        examines the need for a separation of responsibilities among application
        server, container, and primary services, and how OpenEJB provides a powerful
        container system and a set of programming interfaces that make this
        modularization possible.</p>

        <section title="The container-server contract" ref-id="contract.concept">
        
        <p>Enterprise JavaBeans
        defines a portable server-side component model for enterprise computing. EJB
        clearly specifies a bean-container contract and a client-server contract that
        allow developers to switch EJB server products in an enterprise system without
        significant redevelopment costs. While the EJB specification defines
        portability in terms of the enterprise-bean and EJB-client programming models,
        the EJB servers themselves - all the subsystems that lie between the enterprise
        beans and the client applications - remain proprietary. </p>
        
        </section>
        
        <!--1.1.3-->
        <section title="No formal contract in the EJB specification" ref-id="no.formal.contract">
            
        <p>The Enterprise JavaBeans
        specification does not define a server-container contract. This omission is
        intentional; it was done to facilitate maximum flexibility for vendors defining
        EJB server technologies. Beyond isolating the beans from the application
        server, the container’s responsibility in the EJB system is vague. At the
        application server level, the EJB specification defines only a bean-container
        contract and does not define the server-container contract. </p>
        
        <p>It is difficult to determine
        exactly, for example, which is responsible for resource management and other
        services, the container or the application server. Without a clear
        separation of responsibilities between the container and the application
        server, EJB vendors must bear the burden of implementing the entire platform,
        including the distributed-object service, naming, transaction management,
        security, and EJB container. As a result, commercial EJB servers tend to be
        complex monolithic platforms with proprietary and hidden implementations. </p>
        
        </section>
        
        <!--1.1.4-->
        <section title="The need for a contract" ref-id="need.contract">
        
        <p>The advantage to defining a
        server-container contract is that it allows third-party vendors to produce
        containers that can plug into any application server. If the responsibilities
        of the container and application server are clearly defined, then vendors who
        specialize in the technologies that support these different responsibilities
        can focus on developing the container or application server that best matches
        their core competencies. Web vendors focus on managing web requests; CORBA
        vendors focus on distributed-object requests; TP monitors focus on transaction
        management. Meanwhile, the EJB container vendor focus on managing the
        enterprise beans within the container.  Until now this separation of
        responsibilities did not exist. </p>

    <!--1.2-->
    <section title="The OpenEJB server-container contract" ref-id="have.contract">
    
    <p>OpenEJB is a pre-built,
    self-contained, portable EJB 1.1 container system that can be plugged into any
    application server environment. OpenEJB provides a clear separation of
    responsibilities between the EJB container and the EJB server. The application
    server and OpenEJB container system interact through an elegant and powerful
    programming interface, which forms the server-container contact. This contract
    is defined by the Server-Container Interface (SCI), a small, simple, and
    refined set of classes and interfaces.</p>
    
        <!--1.2.1-->
        <section title="The application server’s role" ref-id="servers.role">
        
        <p>Application servers that
        use OpenEJB are responsible for providing client applications with naming and
        remote access to the application server. Its services may include providing
        JNDI and proxy implementations that fulfill the client-server contract of the EJB
        programming model. In application servers that will use OpenEJB locally, such
        as servlet engines, OpenEJB already provides the necessary JNDI and proxy
        implementations. When a client makes a request on a remote bean reference, the
        application server delivers the request to the OpenEJB container system, which
        delegates the request to the appropriate enterprise bean and applies
        transaction, connectors and security services appropriately. </p>
        
        <p>The Apache Tomcat server
        is a good example of an application server that could easily be extended using
        OpenEJB to provide its servlets with a complete EJB container system.  Enydra
        and OpenORB are other examples of application servers that would benefit from
        OpenEJB integration.</p>

        <section title="The container’s role" ref-id="containers.role">
        
        <p>OpenEJB manages the
        enterprise bean’s lifecycle and coordinates the application of transactions
        (distributed or local), connectors, and security as defined by the EJB 1.1
        specification. To manage these tasks in a way that is flexible and
        customizable, OpenEJB also enforces a separation of these responsibilities into
        separate services. OpenEJB provides a Service Provider Interface (SPI) for
        transaction, connectors and security services. These simple and flexible
        container-service contracts are based on simple adapters and industry standards
        like the Connector API and Java Transaction API (JTA), so it is easy for
        service providers to support the SPI and plug directly into OpenEJB. In
        addition, services are swappable and are easily configured by the application
        server vendor as well as the customer. </p>

        OpenEJB is the first EJB container system that allows developers of an EJB
        platform to assemble it from existing products rather than construct it from
        scratch. Vendors focus on what they do best while OpenEJB provides the
        container to host Enterprise JavaBeans. When plugged into any Java compatible
        application server, the result is a complete, yet modular Enterprise JavaBeans
        1.1 container system. Through the server-container interface (SCI), an
        application server vendor can use the OpenEJB container system to create an
        instant and customizable EJB 1.1 platform. Through the service-provider
        interface (SPI), primary services may be interchanged to match any target
        environment's specific requirements. Figure 1 shows how OpenEJB separates
        responsibilities of the application server, container, and primary services.</p>

        <section title="The containers" ref-id="containers">
        
        <p>The OpenEJB container
        system provides three robust container types, including stateless and stateful
        session-bean containers, and entity-bean containers for both bean- and
        container-managed entity beans. These containers are strictly compliant with
        the EJB 1.1 specification, and provide the full complement of security and
        transaction behaviors to beans. The OpenEJB containers are very lightweight
        because they multiplex requests concurrently, requiring less overhead to
        service more beans. The containers are also extremely fast because they
        introduce virtually no bottlenecks to service requests, allowing thousands of requests
        to execute within the container system simultaneously. </p>

        <p>OpenEJB defines three
        primary services: Transaction, security, and connectors. The containers use the
        transaction, security, and connector services while servicing beans and
        performing other responsibilities: the transaction service provides the
        container with transactional integrity; the security service provides
        authorization control; the connectors provides an API for managing resource
        connections like JDBC and Java Message Service (JMS).</p>

        <section title="The IntraVM server" ref-id="intravm.server">
        
        <p>OpenEJB includes an
        IntraVM server that allows for swift interaction among beans in the same
        virtual machine. While respecting the remote semantics required by EJB,
        optimizations in method calls from one bean to another provide for very fast
        throughput and little or no latency. The IntraVM provides an immediately
        available platform for application servers that do not need to support client
        access through distributed objects. For example, an existing servlet engine or
        web server can use the IntraVM server to integrate the OpenEJB container
        systems with very little effort. </p>
        
        </section>
        
        <!--1.3.5-->
        <section title="Customizable" ref-id="customizable">
        
        <p>OpenEJB provides a core
        package that is a powerful default implementation of a container system. While
        this core is well engineered for performance and efficiency, it is possible to
        replace parts of the core system in favor of custom implementations. For
        example, the passivation strategy in the stateful container, which currently
        writes to a file, can be swapped out in favor of one that writes to a RDMBS or
        some other secondary storage. </p>
        
        <p>Developers can also add
        custom containers to extend the scope of the container system. A container that
        uses JNI to interface with an ERP system, for example, could be integrated with
        other core OpenEJB containers. Even the configuration system in OpenEJB, which
        currently uses a flexible XML DTD, can be replaced. A proprietary container
        assembler could replace the current assembler to build containers from a
        database - or even read another vendor's configuration file to load a container
        system at runtime. Practically every feature of OpenEJB is replaceable,
        providing vendors and customers with unparalleled customization and
        flexibility. However, customization is not at all necessary. OpenEJB includes a
        powerful core package that makes it an extremely fast container system. </p>

        <p>The OpenEJB container

        integrate OpenEJB into their application server products easily. OpenEJB
        provides application server vendors without EJB support a fast track to EJB
        compliance. OpenEJB also opens up the integration of transaction, security, and
        connector services so that vendors and customers alike can choose the services
        that are the most appropriate for their EJB platforms. Service providers can
        quickly adapt their products to OpenEJB SPI, allowing them to compete with

        universal solution for any application server that needs EJB functionality.
        OpenEJB represents a revolution in application server design, a view that
        application servers' subsystems should be built by organizations that
        specialize in those subsystems, then bolted together to create a single
        complete platform, turning the potential of modularization into a reality.</p>

        represents another revolution in software, one that has a special synergy with
        modular application server development. Open source exposes the code so that
        everyone understands how the software works; modular application server
        software like OpenEJB exposes public programming interfaces so that it can be
        assembled into an endless variety of platforms. Together, open source and

    <section title="Overview" ref-id="contract.overview">
    
    <p>The Server-Container
    Contract defines the separation of responsibilities between the application
    server and the OpenEJB container system.  The server and container systems
    interact exclusively through the interfaces and classes in the org.openejb package[1], which are collectively refereed to
    as the Server-Container Interface (SCI).  The sever-container contract is
    defined by the SCI as well as the policies enumerated in this section of the
    OpenEJB specification.</p>

        container system at runtime. The container system is responsible for managing enterprise
        beans at runtime according to the information provided in their XML deployment
        descriptors[2]. 
        The container system interposes between requests made by the server and
        serviced by enterprise beans.  The container system interposes to provide transaction,
        authorization security, and connector support for beans servicing requests from
        the server.  The transaction, security, and connector services used during
        interposition are those assigned to the container system by the configuration.

            RPC protocol including JRMP, RMI-IIOP, IIOP, SOAP, and, hypothetically, DCE and
            DCOM.  The RpcContainers
            assume that a call is synchronous and that arguments, return values, and
            exceptions will adhere to the Java RMI-IIOP API policies defined by the EJB 1.1
            specification -- the actual protocol can be anything.  The server is
            responsible for translating arguments, return values, and exceptions between
            the RpcContainer.invoke()
            method and the distributed object protocol used by the server.</p>
            
            <p>The RpcContainer extends the Container interface
            and defines one method, invoke( );
            The invoke() method
            is used by the server to delegate bean requests to the RpcContainer.</p>

            <p>The DeploymentInfo represents a unique bean
            deployment in the container system.  It maintains all deployment information
            about the bean that may be useful to the server in determining the behavior and
            identity of a specific bean deployment.  DeploymentInfo objects are uniquely
            identified within the container system by their deployment-id. The
            deployment-id can be used in the getDeploymentInfo()
            method, defined in both the OpenEJB class and Container interface to obtain a
            specific DeploymentInfo object.</p>

</code-block>
            
            <p>Its expected that most
            servers will associate a deployment-id with a remote reference connection,
            since the server must supply the deployment-id when invoking the RpcContainer.invoke()
            method.  Servers can use the DeploymentInfo to obtain information about the
            bean as well as obtaining a direct reference to the bean’s container.</p>
            
            <p>The deployment-id is
            often the same as the JNDI lookup name used by remote clients to access the
            bean. This is not a requirement, but can make it direct client requests to the
            correct container and DeploymentInfo object.  The deployment-id can, however,
            be any character string as long as deployment-ids are unique with a container
            system.</p>

    <p>The server initializes
    the OpenEJB container system at server start-up or before the first bean
    request is serviced. Every bean deployment has an id, called the <i>deployment-id</i>,
    that is unique within a container system. The server must provide its RPC
    clients with a naming service that maps names to deployment-ids associated with
    RpcContainers. In many cases the naming service’s name binding may be the same
    as the deployment-id, but this is not required. When the client performs a name
    service lookup, the server will return a home reference; a proxy or stub that
    implements the bean's home interface.</p>
    
    <p>The server is responsible
    for providing the distributed communication infrastructure (proxies, network
    protocol handlers, dispatchers, etc.)  for remote references.  Every remote
    reference provided by the server is associated with a specific deployment-id,
    which in turn maps to a specific RpcContainer. 
    When the client invokes a method on a bean or home reference, the server will
    either delegate the request to reference's RpcContainer or service the request itself.</p>
    
    <p>In general, create,
    remove, finder, and business methods are delegated to the reference's RpcContainer.  The values
    returned or exceptions thrown are propagated to the server's clients.  The
    server itself services all other methods of the EJBHome and EJBObject interfaces because these methods
    require the creation of distributed communication artifacts specific to the
    server's distributed object protocol  (i.e. Handle and EJBMetaData) or that are easily handled by the
    server (i.e. EJBObject.isIdentical()
    and EJBObject.getPrimaryKey()).</p>
    
    <p>The server delegates all
    RPC requests to RPC container using the RpcContainer.invoke() method. The invoke() method will either
    return normally or throw an exception.  Normal return values are propagated to
    client, exceptions are handled according to the exception policies outlined in

                or some type of EJB application exception. The server must propagate the cause
                of the ApplicationException
                to the client.  When an ApplicationException
                is thrown, the cause is considered to be normal; it does not represent a system

    <p>Included in the service
    provider interface of OpenEJB is the Connector API.  The Connector API is a standard
    J2EE API that defines a contract between the “application server” and resource
    connectors.  Resource connectors are technology specific APIs for accessing
    backend systems like relational databases, messaging services, and ERP
    systems.  The most familiar resource APIs are JDBC and JMS.  It is the
    responsibility of the “application server” to manage the pooling and
    application of transactions and security services to resource connections used
    by enterprise beans.  It's the responsibility of the connectors to provide
    physical resource connections and the facilities for manufacturing those
    connections.  The Connector API specifies how “application server” and the
    connectors interact to manage resource connections.  </p>

    provides a mechanism for declaring connectors and their connection managers in
    the XML configuration file.  OpenEJB also provides connection managers with
    access to the appropriate transaction and security service at runtime through a
    standard JNDI name space. </p>
    
    <p>A connection manager is
    responsible for managing resource connections according the contracts defined
    in the Connector API.  This includes pooling and sharing connections as well as
    managing the transaction and security contexts of connection at runtime.  
    Connection managers implement the javax.resource.spi.ConnectionManager
    interface defined in the Connector API.    </p>
    
    <p>A resource connection
    (a.k.a. connector) is responsible for providing physical connections to a
    backend resource such as a relational database or enterprise messaging system. 
    A connector must implement the SPI contracts defined by the Connector API
    specification in addition to a technology specific API.  For example, a JDBC
    connector will implement the Connector SPI as well as the JDBC API. Similarly,
    a JMS connector will implement the Connector SPI and the JMS API.  The
    Connector SPI is used by the connection manager to mange the physical resource
    connections -- independent of the type of backend resource accessed by the
    connector.  The technology specific API is used by enterprise beans to work
    directly with the backend resource accessed by the connector.  For example, an
    enterprise bean will use the JDBC API to query, update, and delete records in a
    relational database system.</p>
    
    <p>The advantage of the
    Connector API is that it allows any Connector compliant resource to work with
    any Connector compliant application server.  A vendor who creates a connector
    for a specific backend resource can be assured that their product will work
    with any application server that supports the Connector API.  Before the
    introduction of the Connector API, organizations were limited to the resource
    connections supported by their application server.  The Connector API largely
    eliminates this limitation. If your application server is complaint with the
    connector API, it should automatically support any existing and newly defined
    connectors.</p>
    
    <p>OpenEJB takes this
    portability a step further by making the connection managers plugable.  In most
    application servers, the vendor will offer one or more connection manager
    options, but the selection of connection managers are fixed and proprietary --
    they are built into the application server.  OpenEJB, on the other hand, allows
    any third party to define a connection manager that can easily be plugged into
    OpenEJB and used at runtime to manage connectors.   The connection manager
    defined by the third party is responsible for pooling connections and
    interacting with connectors according to the Connector API.  OpenEJB is
    responsible for providing the connection manager with access to a JTA
    TransactionManager and the security service.  In addition, OpenEJB provides
    enterprise beans with access to connectors through their JNDI environment
    naming context (ENC).  The bean uses only the resources technology specific API
    and is not aware of the connector API, which is only used by the connection
    manager.</p>
    
    <p>While developing
    connectors and connection managers is not trivial, plugging third party
    connectors and connection managers into OpenEJB is very easy.  Both connectors
    and connection managers are declared in the facilities section of OpenEJB's XML
    configuration file.  The following example shows that multiple connectors can
    be assigned to the same connection manager.  In this case the OpenEJB JDBC
    Connector and a JMS connector provide by the Acme corporation are assigned to
    the Connection manager provided by Blue Sky corporation.</p>

    <p>Connectors can be
    assigned to any one of several connection managers. Connectors can be assigned
    to any one of several connection managers. For example, there could be four

    assigned to one connection manager, while the other two are assigned to the
    other connection manager.</p>
    
    <p>Enterprise beans access
    connectors as resources through their JNDI ENC.  The connector-id used in the
    deceleration of a resource is mapped directly to connector-id of a connector in

    map to connectors shown in the previous example.</p>

        <section title="Note on January 4, 2001" ref-id="connector.notes">
        
        <p>The Connector API is near
        completion but is not yet in its final release.  As a result there are no
        connectors currently available.  While its believed that vendors will quickly
        release a cornucopia of connectors following the specification's final release,
        the OpenEJB project provides an interim solution: a JDBC connector that can be
        used with any JDBC driver. The JDBC connector is packaged under org.openejb.resource.jdbc.
        It can be used to wrapper any JDBC driver and make it Connector compliant
        (limited).  The OpenEJB JDBC connector is currently limited to local
        transactions (see Connector specification) and does not provide support for the
        XA interfaces and 2-phase commit.  This is likely to change in the coming
        months.  In the mean time, organizations can use the OpenEJB JDBC connector to
        access any JDBC compliant database within a local transaction.  </p>
        
        <p>OpenEJB also provides a
        connection manager, the org.openejb.resource.SharedLocalConnectionManager,
        that can be used to manage any connector that supports local transactions.  In
        addition the SharedLocalConnectionManager
        supports connection sharing, so that components in a chain of execution will
        automatically share the same physical connection and local transaction.  This
        makes it possible to support a transaction for a single resource that spans
        several components in the same unit-of-work.  </p>
        
        <p>For example, bean A calls
        bean B which calls bean C.  All three beans access the same JDBC resource from
        their JNDI ENC (the res-id is the same).  With connection sharing bean B and C
        will use the same physical JDBC connection used by bean A. When the
        unit-of-work is complete and all the beans have completed their work, the
        transaction on the JDBC connection will be committed.  All the work preformed
        on that physical connection by each of the beans is committed or rollback
        together; its atomic.  However, connection sharing does not allow different
        resources to be enrolled in the same local transaction. If for example, beans
        A, B, and C all access JDBC and JMS resources, then the JDBC work will be
        committed together and the JMS work will be committed together, but the JDBC
        and JMS work will be committed separately.  If the JDBC commit fails, the JMS
        commit will still be executed.  That's the limitation of a shared local
        connection manager. A connection manager that supports 2-phase commit would
        ensure that these different resources succeed or fail together.  Its likely
        that a connection manager that supports 2-phase commit will be provided by
        OpenEJB or some third party in the future.</p>
        
        <p>From a developers stand
        point the connectors are a non-issue.  The developer simply declares which
        connectors are used with which connection managers and maps the connectors as
        resources enterprise bean's JNDI ENC.   Its our hope that others will consider
        developing connection managers that can be used with OpenEJB.  Over the coming
        weeks the OpenEJB-ConnectionManager interface will be refined. Currently,
        OpenEJB provides connector managers with access to the TransactionManager used
        by the bean requesting access to a resource. </p>

    <p>The OpenEJB class manufactures an instance of OpenEJB with a complete
    container system that is ready to accept bean requests. Essentially, the server
    will use the static init( )
    method of the OpenEJB
    class to bootstrap a container system.  The Properties object passed as an
    argument to the init( )
    method is combined with the System properties and passed to the constructor of
    an OpenEJB instance.  </p>
    
<code-block>
    Properties props = new Properties();
    ...
    OpenEJB ejb =
    org.openejb.OpenEJB.init(props);
</code-block>
    
    <p>The OpenEJB instance is responsible initiating the
    construction of container system by locating the correct Assembler and providing it with access to
    configuration information. The Assembler is responsible for constructing every
    artifact of the container system and preparing it to service bean requests
    based on configuration information.  The type of Assembler and the source of
    the configuration information can be identified through properties, which can
    be declared in the Properties argument or in the system class properties. </p>
    
    <p>The Assembler property
    uses the property name &quot;org/openejb/assembler_class&quot;.
    This property name is bound to the fully qualified class name of the Assembler
    class used to build the OpenEJB container system. The default implementation
    is, which is used if an Assembler property is not specified, is the org.openejb.core.conf.Assembler. 
    The Assembler is responsible for constructing the entire container system using
    the configuration information.  </p>
    
    <p>The configuration source
    property uses the property name &quot;org/openejb/configuration_source&quot;. This
    property identifies the source of the configuration information used to build
    the container system. The configuration source may be a local file, remote
    location, a database table, etc.  The configuration information itself can take
    any form as long as it works with the named Assembler.  The default Assembler expects a XML
    file that is located on the local hard drive and conforms to the <i>openejb_config.dtd</i>.</p>
    
    <p>The Assembler and
    configuration source property names are conveniently declared as static fields
    in org.openejb.EnvProps class. </p>
    
<code-block>
    package org.openejb;
    
    public class EnvProps {
        
        public final static String
    CONFIGURATION = &quot;org/openejb/configuration_source&quot;;
        public final static String ASSEMBLER
    = &quot;org/openejb/assembler_class&quot;;
    }
</code-block>
    
    <p>If the core OpenEJB implementation
    is to be used, the  EnvProps.ASSEMBLER
    property should not be declared since the default is to use the core Assembler
    class.  The EnvProps.CONFIGURATION
    property, however, must be set to the file location of the XML configuration
    file on the local hard drive. </p>
    
    <p>It's possible to develop
    and use a custom Assembler class.  This would be useful if custom containers or
    other artifact are needed that can not be constructed by the default core
    Assembler.  Some vendors may, for example, want to use a configuration schema
    that is different then the XML schema used with OpenEJB's core library. This
    would require a new or modified Assembler.   If a custom Assebler is needed, it
    can be specified in the properties along with its custom configuration.  For
    example, an assembler might be constructed that can build an container system
    off of a Weblogic properties files. </p>
    
<code-block>
    Properties props = new Properties();
    props.addProperty(EnvProps.ASSEMBLER, 
        &quot;com.acme.openejb.weblogic_assembler&quot;);
    props.addProperty(EnvProps.CONFIGURATION,
        &quot;c://openejb/welogic.props&quot;);
