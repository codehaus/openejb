    <title>OpenEJB 1.0 Status</title>


      <section title="New Features">
    <p>
Anyone using 0.9.2 will be able to use the
forthcoming 1.0 without any changes to config files or anything, so
it's safe to get started with that till 1.0 is cut.
</p>
<p>
    Noteable things new in 1.0 include:
      <ul>
      <li>Webadmin (Web Administration Console)</li>
      <li>EJB 2.0 Local interface support</li>
      <li>New per-webapp embeddability</li>
      <li>The openejb-jar.xml now optional</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <section title="Webadmin">
    <p>
    The Webadmin is very innovative in that it lets you plug-in your own
    admin beans.  Here is a project that already takes advantage of the
    new feature.

<section title="Per-webapp Tomcat support">
<p>
OpenEJB 1.0 has the ability to load OpenEJB into webapps as an alternative to
loading it into Tomcat as a whole.  This means each webapp can have
it's very own EJB container AND the ejbs can actually *see* the
classes in the WEB-INF/lib and WEB-INF/classes directories.
</p>
<p>
This is a new feature that is not very well tested or documented.  Here are some more details: <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@openejb.org/msg00182.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@openejb.org/msg00182.html</a>

<section title="Local interface support">
<p>
  OpenEJB 2.0 code it to become EJB 2.1 compliant.
  Doesn't yet support embedding in Tomcat, or the openejb.conf file
  structure.  When we get further along we will add those features back
  in--it's a fair amount of work.  There won't be any official 2.0
  releases until we get that stuff back in.
