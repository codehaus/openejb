        <question>Cannot find container "FOO" for bean "BAR"</question>
        <answer id="noContainer">
            <p>
                When a bean gets deployed in OpenEJB, it gets associated with
                a particular container.  Subsequently, that container may not
                be configured in that instance of the server.  When the server
                loads the Jar with the deployed beans, it places beans
                in the containers that the beans were configured with.  Here, the
                bean BAR wants to go into the container FOO, which is not
                currently configured.

        <question>Cannot find bean "FOO" referenced by bean "BAR".</question>
        <answer id="noReference">
            <p>
                When a bean gets deployed in OpenEJB, it may contain references to
                other beans.  Subsequently, those beans may not
                be configured in that instance of the server.  When the server
                loads the Jar with the deployed beans, it stores those references 
                to those beans.  Here, the bean BAR references FOO, which is not
                currently configured in the JNDI namespace.

                This message is usally the result of a deployment descriptor that
