/**
 * This class represents all artifacts of the IntraVM in a stream.
 * <p>
 * Classes create this object in the writeReplace method.
 * <p>
 * When the object is serialized, the writeReplace method is invoked
 * and this artifact is written to the stream instead.  The original
 * object instance is placed in a HashMap and not serialized.
 * <p>
 * During deserialization, it is this object that is deserialized.
 * This class implements the readResolve method of the serialization API.
 * In the readResolve method, the original object instance is retrieved
 * from the HashMap and returned instead.
 * <p>
 * <P>
 * Basically, we mark all local serialization operations the same
 * way you would mark a transaction.
 * <p>
 * <h2><b>LOCAL to LOCAL SERIALIZATION</b></h2> <p>
 * 
 * <i>Definition:</i><p>
 *     This is a full serialization/deserialization takes place in
 *     the local vm inside the marked scope of the IntraVM server.
 * <p>
 * <i>Circumstances:</i><p>
 *     When an IntraVM implementation of a javax.ejb.* interface is
 *     serialized in the scope of a local IntraVM serialization.
 * <p>
 *     These serializations happen when objects are passed as
 *     parameters or return values from one client/ejb to another
 *     client/ejb running inside the same VM.
 * <p>
 * <i>Action:</i><p>
 *     Temporarily cache the instance in memory during
 *     serialization, retrieve again during deserialization.
 * <p>
 * <i>Example Scenario:</i><p>
 *     BEFORE SERIALIZATION<br>
 * <br>1.  Call IntraVmCopyMonitor.preCopyOperation().
 * <br>2.  Method parameters are sent to ObjectOutputStream.
 * 
 * <p>SERIALIZATION<br>
 * <br>3.  ObjectOutputStream encounters an IntraVmMetaData instance
 *         in the object graph and calls its writeReplace method.
 * <br>4.  The IntraVmMetaData instance determines it is being
 *         serialized in the scope of an IntraVM serialization by
 *         calling IntraVmCopyMonitor.isIntraVmCopyOperation().
 * <br>5.  The IntraVmMetaData instance creates an IntraVmArtifact
 *         that caches it in a static hashtable keyed on a
 *         combination of the thread id and instance hashCode.
 * <br>6.  The IntraVmMetaData instance returns the IntraVmArtifact
 *         instance from the writeReplace method.
 * <br>7.  The ObjectOutputStream serializes the IntraVmArtifact
 *         instance in place of the IntraVmMetaData instance.
 * <P> DESERIALIZATION<br>
 * <br>8.  ObjectInputStream encounters and deserializes an
 *         IntraVmArtifact instance and calls its readResolve method.
 * <br>9.  The IntraVmArtifact instance uses the key it created in
 *         step 5 to retrieve the IntraVmMetaData instance from the
 *         static hashtable.
 * <br>10. The IntraVmArtifact instance returns the IntraVmMetaData
 *         instance from the readResolve method.
 * <br>11. ObjectInputStream places the IntraVmMetaData instance in
 *         the object graph in place of the IntraVmArtifact
 *         instance.
 * <P>AFTER<br>
 * <br>12. Method parameters are now de-referenced as mandated by the
 *         spec and can be passed into the bean's method.
 * <br>13. IntraVmCopyMonitor.postCopyOperation() is called, ending
 *         the local IntraVm serialization scope.
