 * 
 * 18.1.1 Application exceptions
 * 
 * An application exception is an exception defined in the throws clause of a
 * method of the enterprise bean’s home and component interfaces, other than
 * the java.rmi.RemoteException.
 * 
 * Enterprise bean business methods use application exceptions to inform the
 * client of abnormal application-level conditions, such as unacceptable values
 * of the input arguments to a business method. A client can typically recover
 * from an application exception.
 * 
 * Application exceptions are not intended for reporting system-level problems.
 * 
 * ---------------
 * 
 * 
 * This exception is thrown when a normal EnterpriseBean exception is thrown.  
 * 
 * The ApplicationException's nested exception will be either an EJB spec 
 * defined ApplicationException ( or a custom exception defined by the bean
 * developer) or a RemoteException.
 * 
 * The org.openejb.ApplicationException must be caught and its nested
 * exception rethrown by the bean proxy to the client.
 * 
 * The org.openejb.ApplicationException is non-system exception; it does NOT
 * indicate a problem with the contaienr itself.
 *

 * @see InvalidateReferenceException
