        <question>What is CVS?</question>
        <answer id="whatiscvs">
            <p>
            The Concurrent Versions System (CVS) provides network-transparent source
            control for groups of developers.  CVS has four basic functions:
            </p>

            <ul>
            <li>Maintains a history of all changes made to each directory tree it manages</li>
            <li>Provides hooks to support process control and change control</li>
            <li>Provides reliable access to its directory trees from remote hosts using Internet protocols</li>
            <li>Supports parallel development allowing more than one developer to work on the same sources at the same time</li>
            </ul>          

            <p>
            All the OpenEJB source code, documentation, and other files are in a CVS
            repository on a server at SourceForge.  To access the repository and 
            download the source code and other files, you need a cvs client.

            If you are on a Linux machine, you most likely already have cvs.  To 
            find out if cvs is intalled, type the following command at a prompt:
            <br/><br/>
            <command>which cvs</command>
            </p>    

            <p>
            If you are one a Windows machine, you will need to download the CVS command-line 
            client <a href="http://ftp.cvshome.org/win32/cvs1-11-1p1.zip">for Windows</a>.
            </p>    

            <p>    
            The CVS command line client is available on many operating systems. 
            Choose the CVS client that's right for your OS at the official 
            <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/downloads.html">CVS download</a>  
            page.

        <question>How do I install CVS?</question>
        <answer id="installingcvs">
            <p>
            There is no "Install Shield" for cvs. You just put the cvs executable in
            any directory and then include that directory in your PATH system     
            variable. Then you can execute cvs commands from anywhere in your 
            command shell.  
            </p>    
        
            <h3>Set the PATH variable</h3>
            <p>
            To set the PATH variable on a Windows machine, execute the following command 
            in a command prompt.<br/><br/>
            <command>set PATH=%PATH%;C:\the\path\where\cvs\is</command>
            </p>
    
            <h3>Set the CVSROOT variable</h3>
        
            <p>
            To execute cvs commands against a CVS repository, you must 
            tell cvs where the repository is by setting its location in a CVSROOT 
            evironment variable, or by specifying it in your command with the cvs -d option.
            </p>    
        
            <p>
            To set the CVSROOT variable on a Windows machine so that it points toward
            the OpenEJB cvs at CodeHaus, execute the following command in a command 
            prompt.<br/><br/>
            <command>set CVSROOT=:pserver:anon@cvs.openejb.codehaus.org:/scm/openejb</command>
            </p>    
    
            <h3>Set the HOME variable</h3>
            <p>
        The first time you access a particular CVS repository, you must first login 
        to the server hosting the repository.  You can do this with the 'cvs login' 
        command, but before doing this you need to set another environment variable.  
        CVS needs to know where to put your login information, for this you must set 
        the HOME environment variable on your OS or in your shell.<br/><br/>
        If you are on a Linux/Unix machine, this will already be set, but if you are
        on a Windows machine, you will most likely need to do this manually.
        </p>    
        
        <p>
        To set the HOME variable on a Windows machine, execute the following command 
        in a command prompt.<br/><br/>
        <command>set HOME=C:\any\directory\works</command>
        </p>
