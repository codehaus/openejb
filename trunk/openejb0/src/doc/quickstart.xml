    <title>OpenEJB QuickStart Guide</title>

    <section title="Installation" ref-id="getopenejb">
    
<p>To install OpenEJB, simply <a 
href="http://openejb.sf.net/download.html">download the latest release</a> 
and unpack your zip or tar.gz into the directory where you want OpenEJB to 
live.</p>  

<p>Windows users can download the zip and unpack it with the WinZip 
program.</p> <p>Linux users can download the tar.gz and unpack it with the 
following command:</p> 

<p><command>
tar xzvf openejb-0.8.3.tar.gz
</command></p>

<p>Congradulations, you've installed OpenEJB.</p>

<note>If you are on Mac OS X and have downloaded the tar.gz, don't 
bother trying to unpack it with anything other than the above tar 
command, it won't work.</note>
    <p>
 If you've unpacked OpenEJB into the directory C:\openejb, for example, 
 than this directory is your OPENEJB_HOME directory.  The OPENEJB_HOME
 directory is refered to in various parts of the documentation, so it's
 good to remeber where it is.

    <p>
 Now all you need to do is move to the OPENEJB_HOME directory, the 
 directory where OpenEJB was unpacked, and type:
</p>
<p><command>openejb help</command></p>
 
 For Windows users, that looks like this:
  
<p><command>C:\openejb> openejb help</command></p>
   
 
<p>
 For UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X users, that looks like this:
</p>
 
<p><command>[user@host openejb]# ./openejb.sh help</command></p>
   
 
<p>
 You really only need to know two commands to use OpenEJB, deploy
 and start.  Both are completely documented and have examples.
</p>
 
<p>
 For help information and command options, try this:
</p>
 
<p><command>openejb deploy -help</command><br/>
   <command>openejb start -help</command></p>
   
   
 
<p>
 For examples on using the command and options, try this:
</p>
 
<p><command>openejb deploy -examples</command><br/>
   <command>openejb start -examples</command></p>
 
<p>
 That's it!
</p>

<p>
If you don't have any EJBs or clients to run, try the ubiquitous 
<a href="hello-world.html">Hello World</a> example.
