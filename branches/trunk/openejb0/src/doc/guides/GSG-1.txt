1  Introduction

  The OpenEJB Developer list is where the general OpenEJB community goes 
  to ask questions, make suggestions, chat with other users and 
  developers, and keep a finger on the pulse of the project.
  
  Please feel free to ask as many questions as you need while becoming 
  familiar with the project.  We believe the perspective of those who are 
  new the project is very valuable and we rely on your feedback to make 
  the project easier to use and understand for everyone.  If you have any 
  suggestions on ways we can help those that are new to the project get up 
  to speed more quickly, we are more than willing to listen.
