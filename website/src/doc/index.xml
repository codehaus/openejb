    <title>OpenEJB -- Welcome</title>



    <section title="Welcome to OpenEJB!">
        <p> 
        OpenEJB is an open source, modular, configurable, and extendable EJB Container
        System and EJB Server.
        </p>

        <note>
            <p>
            We are concurrently developing two versions of OpenEJB and working on Apache Geronimo, which can get a
            little confusing for people trying to follow the project.  See the new <a href="status.xml">status page</a> for details on what's going on in OpenEJB.
            </p>

        </note>
        <section title="EJB Server">
            <p>
            OpenEJB comes with fast, lightweight EJB Servers for both
            <a href="embedded.html">Local</a> and <a href="remote-server.html">Remote</a>
            access. That's right, <a href="deploy.html">deploy</a> your EJBs into the 
            container system, then just <a href="start-command.html">start the 
            Remote EJB Server</a> from the command line! Or, put OpenEJB in your class
            path and use it as <a href="embedded.html">an embedded library</a> through 
            the Local EJB Server.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section title="EJB Container System">
            <p>
            As a <a href="containersystem.html">container system</a>, OpenEJB works like 
            a big plug-in for middleware servers like Web servers, CORBA servers, and 
            application servers. By plugging in OpenEJB these servers obtain instant 
            EJB compliance for hosting Enterprise JavaBeans!
