     * 5.3.2 Removing a session object
     * A client may remove a session object using the remove() method on the javax.ejb.EJBObject
     * interface, or the remove(Handle handle) method of the javax.ejb.EJBHome interface.
     * 
     * Because session objects do not have primary keys that are accessible to clients, invoking the
     * javax.ejb.EJBHome.remove(Object primaryKey) method on a session results in the
     * javax.ejb.RemoveException.
     * 
     * ------------------------------------
     * 5.5 Session object identity
     * 
     * Session objects are intended to be private resources used only by the
     * client that created them. For this reason, session objects, from the
     * client’s perspective, appear anonymous. In contrast to entity objects,
     * which expose their identity as a primary key, session objects hide their
     * identity. As a result, the EJBObject.getPrimaryKey() and
     * EJBHome.remove(Object primaryKey) methods result in a java.rmi.RemoteException
     * if called on a session bean. If the EJBMetaData.getPrimaryKeyClass()
     * method is invoked on a EJBMetaData object for a Session bean, the method throws
     * the java.lang.RuntimeException.
     * ------------------------------------
     * 
     * Sections 5.3.2 and 5.5 conflict.  5.3.2 says to throw javax.ejb.RemoveException, 5.5 says to
     * throw java.rmi.RemoteException.
     * 
     * For now, we are going with java.rmi.RemoteException.
