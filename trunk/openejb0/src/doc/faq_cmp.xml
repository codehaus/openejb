<question>What engine does OpenEJB use for CMP persistence?</question>
<answer id="jdo">
<p>
OpenEJB uses Castor JDO for CMP persistence.  The CMP config files are all 
Castor controlled files (www.castor.org). At the moment, most of the 
real juicy CMP configuration file information is at the Castor site. 
There is no difference between configuring a CMP EntityBean in OpenEJB 
than with any other Castor controlled java object, so anything you learn 
about Castor's config files will be applicable.

<question>What is the format for the CMP mapping files?</question>
<answer id="cmp.mapping">
<p>
The Castor JDO mapping file provides a mechanism for binding a CMP 
EntityBean deployed in OpenEJB to a relational database model. This is 
usually referred to as object-to-relational mapping (O/R mapping). O/R 
mapping bridges the gap between an object model and a relational model.
