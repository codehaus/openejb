Usage: openejb start [options]

Example: Simplest scenario

 openejb start

 That's it.  The server will start up and bind to IP 127.0.0.1 and port 4201.

 The following properties would then be used to get an InitialContext
 from the Remote Server.
        
   java.naming.factory.initial      = org.openejb.client.JNDIContext
   java.naming.provider.url         = 127.0.0.1:4201
   java.naming.security.principal   = myuser
   java.naming.security.credentials = mypass

Example: -h

 openejb start -h 10.45.67.8

 This is the most common way to use the OpenEJB Remote Server.  The server will start 
 up and bind to IP 10.45.67.8 and port 4201.

 The following properties would then be used to get an InitialContext
 from the Remote Server.

   java.naming.factory.initial      = org.openejb.client.JNDIContext
   java.naming.provider.url         = 10.45.67.8:4201
   java.naming.security.principal   = myuser
   java.naming.security.credentials = mypass

 DNS names can also be used.

 openejb start -h myhost.foo.com

 The following properties would then be used to get an InitialContext
 from the Remote Server.

   java.naming.factory.initial      = org.openejb.client.JNDIContext
   java.naming.provider.url         = myhost.foo.com:4201
   java.naming.security.principal   = myuser
   java.naming.security.credentials = mypass

Example: -p

 openejb start -p 8765
 
 The server will start up and bind to IP 127.0.0.1 and port 8765.

 The following properties would then be used to get an InitialContext
 from the Remote Server.
        
   java.naming.factory.initial      = org.openejb.client.JNDIContext
   java.naming.provider.url         = 127.0.0.1:8765
   java.naming.security.principal   = myuser
   java.naming.security.credentials = mypass

Example: -conf file   

 openejb start -conf C:\openejb\conf\mytest.conf
 
 Sets the openejb.configuration system variable to the file 
 C:\openejb\conf\mytest.conf.  When the server starts up and
 the initializes OpenEJB, this configuration will be
 used to assemble the container system and load beans. 

Example: --admin-ip addresses   

 openejb start --admin-ip 192.168.1.12
 
 Adds 192.168.1.12 to the list of IP addresses that are 
 authorized to shutdown the server or access the server
 via a telnet client.  The host that this server was 
 started on is always allowed to administer the server.
 
 Multiple hosts can be given administrative access to
 this server by listing all the host names separated
 by commas as such:

 openejb start --admin-ip 192.168.1.12,joe.foo.com,robert
 
 The first host in the string names the host explicitly 
 using an IP address (192.168.1.12). 
 
 The second host in uses a DNS name (joe.foo.com) to refer
 to the hosts IP address.  The DNS name will be resolved 
 and the IP will be added to the admin list. 
 
 The third address refers to a the host by a name (robert)
 that the opperating system is able to resolve into a valid
 IP address.  This is usually done via a hosts file, interal
 DNS server, or Windows Domain Server.
