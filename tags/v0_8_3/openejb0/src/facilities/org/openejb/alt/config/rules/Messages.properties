# 0 - Class name
# 1 - Element (home, ejb-class, remote)
# 2 - Bean name
missing.class           The class {0} not found. Check that the class specified in the {1} element for bean {2} is spelled correctly and the class is present in the jar

# 0 - Class name
# 1 - EJB Class name
wrong.class.type        The class {0} is the wrong type, it does not extend {1}

# 1 - method name
# 2 - remote|home
# 3 - interface name
# 4 - EJB Class name
no.busines.method       Business method {0} not implemented. The method was declared in the {1} interface {2}, but not implemented in the ejb class {3}

# 1 - home interface
# 2 - remote interface
no.home.create          No create method.  The home interface {0} must declare at least one create method. Example:\n\tpublic {1} create() throws javax.ejb.CreateException, java.rmi.RemoteException;\n

# 1 - EJB Class name
# 2 - create params
session.no.ejb.create   Method create method not implemented.  There should be a create method in the bean class {0} with the following signature:\n\tpublic void ejbCreate({1}) throws javax.ejb.CreateException\n

# 1 - EJB Class name
# 2 - primary key class
# 3 - create params
entity.no.ejb.create    Method create method not implemented.  There should be a create method in the bean class {0} with the following signature:\n\n\tpublic {1} ejbCreate({2}) throws javax.ejb.CreateException\n

# 1 - EJB Class name
# 2 - create params
no.ejb.post.create      Entity create method with no matching ejbPostCreate.  There should be an ejbPostCreate method in the bean class {0} with the following signature:\n\n\tpublic void ejbPostCreate({1}) throws javax.ejb.CreateException\n

# 1 - bean class
# 2 - create params
# 3 - home interface
unused.ejb.create       Create method will never be called.  The bean class {0} defines the create method ejbCreate({1}), but there is no matching create({1}) method in the home interface {2}
