      All around good guy to have on your side.  Alan has taken his place among

    <description>
    Stefan is a real "hard hitter" on the OpenEJB project, bringing with
    him not only the solid feedback we've always wanted, but code to back
    it all up!  Stefan rounds out the team nicely and does a great job of
    finding those dusty areas that have gone ignored.

    <description>
      Daniel has been hanging out on the dev list for quite some time.  Recently, 
      he has made his very distingushable mark all over our build system by 
      completely cleaning, reorganizing, modularizing, and completing all those 
      little things that never seem to get done. We can expect more great enchancements
      from Daniel in the future.  His strengths are persistence and extreme 
      organizational skills -- even his emails are specially formatted.

    Our friend from the north, as Alan calls him. Toby is a regular on the dev 
    list and is always giving us good feedback on the various issues that come
    in the list.  Maybe if people lean on him a bit, we can turn him into one
    of the projects contributors ;)

    Another friend from the testing efforts of the summer.  Pizer still comes 'round to 
    give new functionality a spin and tell us what goes wrong.

    Committers are contributors who have written lots of important code,

    of providing good tools for people they don't even know. In return for
    their love and devotion you may bug them with questions, bug fixes,
    patches and offer them free beer.

  <type name="Feedback">
    The following have offered valuable feedback (including bug reports) that has been beneficial
    to the development and stability.
