Usage: openejb start [options]

Starts OpenEJB as an EJB Server that can be accessed by remote 
clients via the OpenEJB Remote Server.

ALWAYS check your openejb.log file for warnings immediately after 
starting the Remote Server.  

OpenEJB issues warnings when it works around a potential problem, 
encounters something it didn't expect, or when OpenEJB wants to 
let you know something may not work as you expected it.
