/**
 * Supports
 *
 * The Container invokes an enterprise Bean method whose transaction attribute
 * is set to Supports as follows.
 *
 * - If the client calls with a transaction context, the Container performs
 *   the same steps as described in the Required case.
 *
 * - If the client calls without a transaction context, the Container performs
 *   the same steps as described in the NotSupported case.
 *
 * The Supports transaction attribute must be used with caution. This is
 * because of the different transactional semantics provided by the two
 * possible modes of execution. Only the enterprise beans that will
 * execute correctly in both modes should use the Supports transaction
 * attribute.
