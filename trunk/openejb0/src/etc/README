===============================================
OpenEJB -- EJB Container System and EJB Server

OpenEJB v0.8beta2        http://openejb.sf.net/
-----------------------------------------------
___________________
Installation
===================
 
 If you are reading this, you've already unpacked the OpenEJB release.  
 In that case, congradulations, you've installed OpenEJB.  
 
 If you've unpacked OpenEJB into the directory C:\openejb, for example.
 Than this directory is your OPENEJB_HOME directory.  The OPENEJB_HOME
 directory is refered to in various parts of the documentation, so it's
 good to remeber where it is.

___________________
Using OpenEJB
===================
 
 Now all you need to do is move to the OPENEJB_HOME directory, the 
 directory where OpenEJB was unpacked, and type:
 
   openejb help
 
 For Windows users, that looks like this:
  
   C:\openejb> openejb help
 
 For UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X users, that looks like this:
 
   [user@host openejb]# ./openejb.sh help
 
 You really only need to know two commands to use OpenEJB, deploy
 and start.  Both are completely documented and have examples.
 
 For help information and command options, try this:
 
   openejb deploy -help
   openejb start -help
 
 For examples on using the command and options, try this:
 
   openejb deploy -examples
   openejb start -examples
 
 That's it!
