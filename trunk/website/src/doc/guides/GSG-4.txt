1 Running the test suite

  To run the test suite, execute the following commands: 
  
  Windows:
    prompt> build.bat clean jar-debug
    prompt> test.bat 
  
  Unix/Linux:
    prompt$ build.sh clean jar-debug
    prompt$ test.sh 
  
  NOTE: You must execute the build and test scripts in the same directory 
  where they are located. 
  
2  Other Issues
  
  By default the configuration files in the test/conf directory of the cvs 
  repository contain file paths that are formatted using the Windows 
  backslash "\". To run the test suite, you must change the backslashes 
  "\\" to front slashes "/" in the following files:
  
       test/conf/basic_RiServer_config.properties
       test/conf/basic_OpenEJB_config.xml
  
  We apologize for this inconvenience and are working on a fix for this.
