/**
 * The ContainerSystem interface represents a complete OpenEJB container system including
 * ContainerManagers, Containers, deployed enterprise beans and the primary services
 * (transaction, security, and persistence).
 * <p>
 * The ContainerSystem serves as the root in the container system hierarchy. The
 * ContainerSystem contains one or more ContainerManagers. ContainerManagers contain
 * one or more Containers. Containers contain one or more deployed beans of particular kind
 * (stateless, stateful, or entity).
 * <p>
 * The access to other parts of the container system hierarchy is not ridged, the
 * ContainerSystem interface provides methods for accessing its ContainerManagers by
 * ID or as a collection. The interface also provides methods for obtaining references to
 * specific Containers and DeploymentInfo objects by ID.  IDs for all elements of the
 * container system are unique across the container system.
 * <p>
 * The default implementation of this interface is provided by the
 * org.openejb.core.ContainerSystem class.
