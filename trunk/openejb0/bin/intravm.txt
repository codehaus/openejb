This option serves a purely educational purpose.

OpenEJB can be used as an embedded EJB library in middleware, 
servers, IDEs, or ordinary applications.  

No startup or shutdown is needed to do this, you simply need 
to include the core library and dependent libraries in your 
classpath.  

For more information on using OpenEJB as an embedded library,
