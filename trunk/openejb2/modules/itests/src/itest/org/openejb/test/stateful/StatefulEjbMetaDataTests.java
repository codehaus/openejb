     * 5.5 Session object identity

     * Session objects are intended to be private resources used only by the
     * client that created them. For this reason, session objects, from the
     * client’s perspective, appear anonymous. In contrast to entity objects,
     * which expose their identity as a primary key, session objects hide their
     * identity. As a result, the EJBObject.getPrimaryKey() and
     * EJBHome.remove(Object id) methods result in a java.rmi.RemoteException
     * if called on a session bean. If the EJBMetaData.getPrima-ryKeyClass()
     * method is invoked on a EJBMetaData object for a Session bean, the method throws
     * the java.lang.RuntimeException.
