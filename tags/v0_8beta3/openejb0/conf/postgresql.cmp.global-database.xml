======================================================
Global Transaction Database file for Container-Managed
Persistence EntityBeans in a CMP Container using
PostgreSQL as the database
======================================================

Other CMP containers can be configured.  Each container
will need a Global_TX_Database file like this one, plus
a Local_TX_Database file and a mapping file.

This configuration is used for global or container 
managed transactions.  This will be used when the 
TransactionManager is managing the transaction, such 
as when the tx attribute is Supports (client has tx), 
RequiresNew, Required or Manditory.

Specifies the configuration for obtaining database 
connections and the mapping.xml schema which describes
how beans map to the database.
